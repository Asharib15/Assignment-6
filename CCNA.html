            <p class="pack">Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) is a technical certification that Cisco offers for
                early-career networking professionals. It covers the following topics: network fundamentals. network
                access. Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity.
                CCNA exam covers networking fundamentals, IP services, security fundamentals, automation and
                programmability. Designed for agility and versatility, CCNA validates that you have the skills required
                to manage and optimize today's most advanced networks.
                Not exactly. There are some scenarios where a CCNA won't act as a good substitute for a traditional
                degree. For example, if your long-term plans involve a Master's degree or Ph. D., earning a four-year
                degree makes sense.
