            <p class="pack">ChatGPT is an artificial-intelligence chatbot developed by AI research company OpenAI.
                Released in November 2022, it can have conversations on topics from history to philosophy, generate
                lyrics in the style of Taylor Swift or Billy Joel, and suggest edits to computer programming code.
                But conversational AI is more of a broad term that covers all AI technologies that enable computers to
                simulate conversations. On the other hand, a chatbot usually means a specific type of conversational AI
                that uses a chat widget as its primary interface.
